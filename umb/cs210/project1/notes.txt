4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I liked this project as a way to get back into the groove of programming with Java.
   While I needed to take some time to think about the logic and code necessary, the problems
   were easy to interpret and solve, they just took some time.
