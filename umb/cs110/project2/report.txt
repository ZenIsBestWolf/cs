4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Wind Chill)
      Approach: Convert math to code & use if statements

      Issues and resolution: None

   Problem 2 (Day of the Week)
      Approach: Convert math to code

      Issues and resolution: This problem was the bane of me and took up 90% of my time with this project.
      Eventually, after researching a separate algorithm called Zeller's, I noticed that it used floored division.
      So when I used integer division (// instead of /) in all calculations, everything worked out.
      This would have been really nice to know before spending so long researching the algorithm and why it might not be working...

   Problem 3 (Playing Card)
      Approach: Generate two random integers and call their respective lists to generate a card

      Issues and resolution: None

   Problem 4 (Root Finding)
      Approach: Convert math to code

      Issues and resolution: None

   Problem 5 (Greatest Common Divisor)
      Approach: Convert math to code

      Issues and resolution: None

   Problem 6 (Fibonacci Number)
      Approach: Convert math to code

      Issues and resolution: None

   Problem 7 (Sum of Powers)
      Approach: Convert math to code

      Issues and resolution: None

   Problem 8 (Dragon Curve)
      Approach: Convert instructions to code

      Issues and resolution: None

   Problem 9 (Perfect Numbers)
      Approach: Convert instructions to code

      Issues and resolution: I ran into some issues with the range statement that were solved with integer division

   Problem 10 (Ramanujan Numbers)
      Approach: Convert instructions to code

      Issues and resolution: It took me quite a while to realize I should be starting my values at their range minimums
      but eventually figured it out. This code runs slow as sin though.
      I needed to attend office hours to resolve this, I was creating an extra loop that was spiraling the time
      needed wildly out of control. Thank you Professor Yee.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Instructions for Day of Week would be helped by being amended to specify integer division/floored division.
