# CS3013 - Operating Systems

This course was one of the most difficult but rewarding courses I have ever completed. I am quite proud of my code and I want to publish it. Not all of this code is solely done by me though, and I will provide details on a per-project basis.

I will probably also polish up my code, standardize repos, and write some explanations for projects in the future.

## Project 1 - The Process Party
Completed Solo - 80/80

This project was a structured introduction to children processes and general system calls.

## Project 2 - Worcester Gompei Park
Completed Solo - 70/70

This project was an abstract introduction to multithreading, mutex locks, and s
emaphores.

## Project 3 - Virtual Memory Manager
Completed with [Nick Gill](https://github.com/nicolas-gill) - 65/90

This project involved creating our own primitive MMU involving multiple processes, limited memory, and swapping. This project was the most stressful and confusing.

## Project 4 - Scheduling Policies
Completed with [Nick Gill](https://github.com/nicolas-gill) - 65/60

This project was an introduction to concepts regarding I/O and was relatively quick.
