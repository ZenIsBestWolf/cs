# CS3516 - Computer Networks

This course focused on the funadmentals of the way computers handled communication with each other. Despite projects not being weighted very highly, they were rewarding regardless.

I may rework these projects (along with CS3013) into Rust programs not only to hone the concepts in those languages, but also to pose a new method of approach for these courses.

## Project 1 - Wireview
Completed Solo - 100/100

This project printed out simple analysis of TCP and UDP packets from a `.pcap` file. It uses linked lists as a lower level replacement for dictionaries (a little primitive I know, but I was not confident in my C++ skills to crack at Sets). Maybe I'll rewrite this sometime to change up the libraries/languages used.

## Project 2 - QR Codes
Completed Solo - 98/100 *initially graded at 0/100*

Not only was this project zeroed out, but no feedback was given. I'd love to know what's missing from this to earn this grade.

Intentionally missing are timeouts and rate limiting because of time constraints. I may implement these in the future.
