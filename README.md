# Zen's CS Repository
This is a repository of the code I wrote while in my Computer Science courses at the University of Massachusetts Boston.
This code is not perfect, and I did not score perfectly on all assignemnts.
**This code is still mine. You cannot submit it as your own code for assignments.**

Each project folder contains three things.
- Code files
- Instructional PDF
- Report File (no longer required)

Exam folders may or may not contain their instructional PDFs due to some being handed out in person, and therefore not backed up. These folders may only contain code.

Use this for assistance understanding processes and to explain problems, **but try on your own first.** My approach is unlikely to be the best approach.

Code is only added after a course concludes.

This repository may be updated to support multiple institutions if I transfer.

**UPDATE:** I have indeed transfered institutions.
UMass Boston coursework is found in the ``umb`` folder.
Worcester Polytechnic Institute coursework is found in the ``wpi`` folder.

New work will be added after the completion of the course, and a grade is 
issued.
